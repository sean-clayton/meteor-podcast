# /i18n
## Description
This folder is where you put your internationalization strings. Read more on this folder [here](https://github.com/TAPevents/tap-i18n#structure-of-languages-files). I try to support English, French, and Spanish on my sites. Feel free to add/remove as you please, but I highly suggest using this approach to your strings in your app.
